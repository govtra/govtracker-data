# GovTracker.org data

[GovTracker.org](https://govtracker.org) // [Sources on Github](https://github.com/govtra/govtracker)

Our goal is to keep track, while keeping a neutral point of view, of the decisions and steps taken by the different governments around the world.

## Participate

All entries must contain two things: a concise description of the entry's topic
and a source (primary source ideally). Additionally we appreciate if articles
providing in deep analysis are added as extra.

There are two ways how to participate.

### Pull requests through Github

Use the [entry_template.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govtra/govtracker-data/master/entry_template.md)
file to create new entries. Please respect the format (look at existing entries for examples). If a file for a given day already exists, simply add your entry as a new paragraph to it, leaving a blank line ([example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/govtra/govtracker-data/master/us_entries/2017-01-25.md)).

If creating entries for new countries, create a folder `CountryCode_entries/`.

### Email

Send your entries to **contact at govtracker.org**
No need to send a properly formatted entry (although it is appreciated).
